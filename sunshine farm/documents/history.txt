A Brief History

The Shops at Diagon Alley have been a fixture in the wizarding community for many, many years. With records that date back to the late fourth century B.C., Diagon's first two establishments were Gringotts Wizarding Bank and Ollivanders Wand Shop - although there is some debate as to which of these establishments came first.

Over the years, many additional shops and dining establishments have sprung up along Diagon Alley, elevating its importance to the wizarding world. A visit to The Shops at Diagon Alley has become an annual rite of passage for young witches and wizards attending Hogwarts, while also remaining the premier choice for any and all kinds of magical purchases - from books, to clothing, to curiousities of all sorts.

For those with slightly darker interests and needs, Knockturn Alley is only a short walk away. Although not formally affiliated, the two shopping districts do share a connection due to their proximity and their tendency to offer sales and events at the same time.

Diagon Alley was honored last year with a designation as one of the "Historical Places of Importance to Magical History", further cementing its place in the wizarding world.






About this Site

While we would love to tell you that The Shops at Diagon Alley are just a jump away on the floo network, the reality is that this entire website is simply a demonstration site used as part of a series of lessons in website design at the University of Rhode Island.

Designed by Jeremy Girard of pumpkin-king.com, this site is in no way affiliated with Harry Potter or JK Rowling. The use of the world in which Harry lives was to make the project more interesting for students and because Jeremy is a huge geek and fan of all things Harry Potter. 

If you truly wish to visit Diagon Alley and the magic of this world, I suggest you pick up the wonderful book series and get started. It is a journey you will never forget.
