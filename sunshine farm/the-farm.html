<h3>what is organic?</h3>
<p>Organic refers to a specific method of growing and processing foods, and is defined as produce grown, packaged and stored without the use of synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides or irradiation. Instead, organic farmers use a blend of old and new technologies and scientific research to balance the Earth’s natural ecosystem. They work with nature to build and replenish the nutrients in the soil through crop rotations, composting and cultivation. This encourages healthy soils which produce healthy plants that are naturally more pest and disease resistant.
