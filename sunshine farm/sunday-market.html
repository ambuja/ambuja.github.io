  <h3>Sunshine Sunday Farm Market</h3>
<p>Sunshine Farm not only grows organic vegetables and herbs also offers Certified Organic eggs, grass-fed beef, pastured pork and seasonal offerings of vegetables, lamb and goat meat, we also host a community Farmer’s Market!  “Support Local” – we are open to the public on Sundays from noon to 4pm during our harvest season (November to May).  Leashed dogs welcomed.  Come check out the farm, listen to great music, have a picnic lunch, shop for local produce and environmentally-friendly products, meet like-minded individuals, and enjoy our orchard and gardens.  Bring your friends and family!  It’s a great way to support local businesses, local/organic agriculture, and our educational and community programs.
The market features:<br />
<br />
	<p>•	Vendors selling environmentally-friendly and handcrafted products, such as wonderful local produce, farm-fresh eggs, artisan breads, organic coffee, raw local honey, organic herbs and Florida-native plants, organic cotton and hemp clothing, beautiful handmade arts and crafts, gardening books, body care products and more.</p><br />
	<p>•	Workshop Series offers informative workshops by guest presenters on sustainable living skills, organic gardening, cooking, holistic healing and more.</p><br /> 
	<p>•	Sunday Yoga  starts an hour before the Market from 11am-12pm.  Bring your own mat or towel and meet us at the firepit.  $5 suggested donation.  Open to all, no reservations required.</p>  <br />
